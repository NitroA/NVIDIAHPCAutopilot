# Building the Dataset

For the project dataset we uses [Roboflow Dataset](https://roboflow.com/), a online platform to build your own image dataset to work with computer vision models. In the case of the project we used roboflow to upload the traffic signs images and draw the bounding-box around the traffic signs for them to be identified on the training and testing from the model.
